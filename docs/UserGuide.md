**Notes about the command format:**<br>

There are 5 CLI command formats as shown below:

1) `COMMAND_WORD`
2) `COMMAND_WORD INDEX`
3) `COMMAND_WORD PARAMETER`
3) `COMMAND_WORD PARAMETERS`

Parameters often take up the form of `p/[PARAMETER]` where p is the parameter symbol. For example:`add n/John Doe`<br>
- `n/` -> parameter symbol<br>
- `John Doe` -> parameter.

**Other things to note in this User Guide:**
1) Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [d/DIAGNOSIS]` can be used as `n/John Doe d/diabetes` or as `n/John Doe`.
2) Parameters can be in any order:<br>
  `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` is equivalent to `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`

3) Extra parameters for commands without parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored:<br>
  `help 123` is interpreted as `help`.

4) If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Glossary

1. **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** A user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical elements such as icons, buttons, and windows, rather than text-based commands. GUIs make it easier for users to navigate and use software applications visually.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
